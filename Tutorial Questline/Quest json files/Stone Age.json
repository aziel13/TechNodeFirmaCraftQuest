There are three types of ore that produce copper when smelted, Native copper, malachite, and tetrahedrite. The best way to get nuggets is to explore. Mark the locations where you find them as an ore vein will be nearby. Later you can use a prospector\u0027s pick to find the vein itself. A gold pan or sluice can be used as a last resort for getting the nuggets you need. This task will accept any of the 3 types of copper.",
