For example 100 units of sphalerite(zinc), 250 units of copper, and 50 units of bismuth together you should get 400 units of bismuth bronze. Black Bronze is an alloy of Copper, Gold and Silver with a ratio between 10% gold, 50% copper, and 10% silver and 25% gold, 70% copper, and 25% silver will get you black bronze.
