Next add one block on each cardinal side (nswe). This is the smallest build for a bloomery. To make it larger you can increase it\u0027s height two blocks. See the TFC wiki for diagrams.",

It is best to start pouring ingots while pumping the pig iron into the crucible. When the pig iron is solid, but still hot enough, hammer out the impurities on your anvil.",
