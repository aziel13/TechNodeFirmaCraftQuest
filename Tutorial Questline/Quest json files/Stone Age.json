Hover over any food item and press D to trim decay off all food. Hover over a food item and press S to stack all of the food into max sized stacks. Decay can also be trimmed by placing food in crafting grid with a knife. If there is no decay then the food stack will be split in half. You process whole grains by crafting them with a knife giving grains and straw. It is best to store grains in this form as they have a slower decay rate.

Mark the locations where you find them as an ore vein will be nearby. Later you can use a prospector\u0027s pick to find the vein itself. A gold pan or sluice can be used as a last resort for getting the nuggets you need. This task will accept any of the 3 types of copper.",

Put a ceramic bowl in the crafting grid to craft a Gold Pan. Now that you have a gold pan, you will need to sift through sand or gravel under running water to try and find bits of native ores. To do this first right click on a block of sand or gravel to fill the pan. Then right-click on running water. You may also find bits of native copper, gold, silver or platinum as you pan depending on your prospecting skill. Not a terrible activity during your first few nights hiding, but be aware you will overwork the chunk in time.",

The stone hoe, using the mode change key, will also let you check if your farmland is hydrated and if the plant on it is ready to be harvested. As you harvest more mature crops your agriculture skill will raise. This increases your chance at getting extra seeds and will unlock information on the nutrients needed for different crops and found in farmland.",
